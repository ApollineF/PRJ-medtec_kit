In this repo there is two bash script:

* ./run_minimal_config.sh that install minimal configuration if you just want to use the kit without modifying the software in the RedPitaya. 
* ./run_full_config.sh, that install all the tools even the ones for compiling C scripts of the RedPitaya.

The tool that will be installed are:

* sshpass
* arduino IDE
* kicad
* ...

Once you have install your configuration, you have to install the RedPitaya, see MDL-redpitaya.

Now to launch the kit you have to push the script in the arduino and in the RedPitaya. Then switch on the electronic.
