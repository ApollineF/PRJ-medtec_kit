## Details ?

ESP-WROOM-32 is a powerful, generic WiFi-BT-BLE MCU module that targets a wide variety of applications
ranging from low power sensor networks to the most demanding tasks such as voice encoding, music streaming
and MP3 decoding.

At the core of this module is the ESP32 chip, which is designed to be scalable and adaptive. There are 2 CPU cores
that can be individually controlled or powered, and the clock frequency is adjustable from 80 MHz to 240 MHz. The
user may also power off the CPU and make use of the low power coprocessor to constantly monitor the peripherals
for changes or crossing of thresholds. ESP32 integrates a rich set of peripherals, ranging from capacitive touch
sensors, Hall sensors, low noise sense amplifiers, SD card interface, Ethernet, high speed SDIO/SPI, UART, I2S
and I2C.

The integration of Bluetooth, Bluetooth LE and Wi-Fi ensures that a wide range of applications can be targeted,
and that it is future proof: using Wi-Fi allows a large physical range and direct connection to the internet through a
Wi-Fi router, while using Bluetooth allows the user to conveniently connect to the phone or broadcast low energy
beacons for its detection. The sleep current of the ESP32 chip is less than 5uA, making it suitable for battery
powered and wearable electronics applications. ESP-WROOM-32 supports data rates up to 150 Mbps, and 22
dBm output power at the PA to ensure the widest physical range. As such the chip does offer industry leading
specifications and the best optimized performance for electronic integration, range and power consumption, and
connectivity.

ESP-WROOM-32 has Espressif’s long term support — ESP32 will be covered under Espressif’s longevity program
and be available for the next 12 years. The design of ESP-WROOM-32 will be open-source when it has been fully
optimized. Feedbacks about the module, chip, API or firmware can be sent to feedback@espressif.com.
