# Implementing image processing techniques [](@description Zach's worklog, simplified, on murgen)

Data is received at each angle. It then undergoes processing to reconstruct it into an image. Each stage of image processing will be demonstrated.

### Setup
![](/include/images/Zach_Stages/Setup.png)

Here's the setup.

### Original

Clearly needs some noise reduction. I'll add a Butterworth filter.


### Implementing a Butterworth Bandpass Filter
![](/include/images/Zach_Stages/Butter.png)

Needs more noise reduction. I'll add a Hilbert transformation.


### Implementing Envelope Detection

Good image... But it seems to fade with distance. I'll add time gain compensation.


### Implementing Time Gain Compensation

Most up to date image.
