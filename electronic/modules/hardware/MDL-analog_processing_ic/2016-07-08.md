# First hands-on with Goblin : an overview [](@description First experiment on 08th July 2016)

## What does it do?

This [Goblin](/electronic/module/hardware/MDL-analog_processing_ic/) board aims at getting a signal, and giving access to key points within the signal processing chain for ultrasound imaging, namely:

* Getting access to a TGC
* Getting the enveloppe of the signal
* Cleaning the signal before feeding in the on-board SPI ADC

All key signals are accessible, and jumpers, as well as pots, enable on-board fine-tuning of the signals. [See more details on the __testing session__, to see the behavior of the board on a oscillo](/electronic/module/hardware/MDL-analog_processing_ic/2016-07-08.md).

### Trying with different frequencies


#### At 3 MHz

#### At 10MHz

### Difference between enveloppe and ADC input?

-> the offset is removed, there's also a small gain (x2).

See below: there's an offset at the enveloppe detection (~RMS), which is removed. Enveloppe is 500mV before, comes at 1V+ afterwards.
