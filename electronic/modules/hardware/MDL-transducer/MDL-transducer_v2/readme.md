## Name
[`MDL-transducer_v2`]()

## Title
Transducer version 2

## Author
* [`CTC-vincent_loyau]()

## About
A transducer is needed to create acoustic wave and to measure echoes.

## Uses
### Input
* -100V pulse
* [ITF-A_gnd]()

### Output
* [ITF-A_gnd]()
* -100V pulse + echoes

## Functions
* [`FCT-sensing_emitting`]()
* [`FCT-sensing_receiving`]()

## Scheme
NA

## Remarks
This was produce at ENS cachan, it's central frequency is around 4 MHZ. [Measurement with impedancemeter](./doc/impedance.png) can be found in doc folder, at resonance, I=16-15i ohms.
